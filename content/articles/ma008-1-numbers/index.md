# 1. Numbers, equations and expressions

## What are numbers
Numbers are abstractions that are used for

* counting
* measuring
* and labeling.

There're different sets of numbers, some of which are also subsets of others. Numbers are divided into types:

* natural
* whole
* integer
* rational
* irrational

While rational set includes all integers, integers include wholes and so on irrational numbers form another not intersecting with the rational set.
It's because of their different nature.

> *Set* is a collection of numbers. *Subset* is another set of numbers that are all container by another one.
>
> Set is denoted usigin curly braces with numbers separated by commas inside: `{1, 3, 5}`

### Natural numbers

`{1, 2, 3 ...}`

Natural numbers are usual numbers that are used for counting. The natural numbers set starts from 1 and infinitely continues.

### Whole numbers

`{0, 1, 2, 3 ...}`

Whole numbers are all natural numbers with addition of `0` (zero). Zero, for instance, can be used to point at absense of something countable.

### Integer numbers

`{... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ...}`

Integer numbers set includes the whole ones and adds negative numbers.
Integer set together with all of its subsets consist of numbers that can be presented without fractions or decimals.

### Rational numbers

Numbers that are presented in form of `a/b` where `a` and `b` are both integer and `b` not equals zero.
The `a` part is named *numerator*, the `b` one — *denominator*.

Rational numbers are called so becaouse the can be written as a *ratio*.

Number `2/3` is read as “two thirds”.

It's important that any integer number can be represented as a rational one. For example, `-17` can be written as `-17/1`. That proves that integers is a subset of rational.

> It's very important for me that already proven statements shouldn't be proved twice. For instance, integer set includes all whole and natural numbers.
> Thus it's needless to test if those subsets also belong to rational numbers set.

#### Decimal numbers

Every decimal number that can be written as a fraction is rational. It can be:

* terminating decimal, `0.4375`
* repeating, `0.33` (it is marked with a horizontal line above repeated part) — the representation of `1/3`.

### Irrational numbers
There're many decimal numbers that don't have terminating or repeating pattern of decimals. Therefore they cannot be written as a fraction and are not rational. These numbers are called *irrational*.
For example, there're some physical and mathematical irrational constants:

> **Pythagorean theorem.** It declares the lenght of hyphothenuse it any right triangle.
> It looks so: `a² + b² = c²`, where `a` and `b` represent cathetuses and `c` represents hypothenuse.

## Real numbers
Real numbers are all numbers, including rational and irrational.

```
e = 2.71828...
pi = 3.14159...
```

## Equations

Equation is an equality containing one or more variables, e.g. `2x + 3 = 15x - 20`.
It is called so because of *equality sign*, `=`.

*Variables* in equations mean some values that gonna change and act like slots where actual values can be plugged in.
Variables often appear in form of latin or greek letters, but in fact maybe anything at all including emoji or any other signs.

> Sometimes constants are presented in form of letters (like Pi) for convenience.

Numbers together with variables form *expressions*.

### Expressions

Expression is a combination of numbers and variables consist of *terms*. For example, `2x + 3` is an expression.
According to their nature, there're *constant terms* (`2000`) that are actual numbers and *variable terms* that include variable.

The number beside a variable is called a *coefficient* (`2` in `2x` term).

Constant terms are often called constants for short.


## Lesson timing

*February 25, 2016*

*The lesson itself took roughly 2 hours and its abstracting about half an hour.*


P.S There're 34 lessons and some parts between them. I think the whole course will took about 80-90 hours of work, which equals to 15 weeks of 6 hours each or 3-3.5 months. Let's look at it.
