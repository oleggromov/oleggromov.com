# Weekly bookmarks #1

Recently I rewrote my blog publishing system from scratch, named it Oxypogon and returned to the idea of blogging regularly. But what about should I write if no great article is finished yet but there's blog, and it is waiting? Certainly about things that are worth reading, seeing and knowing about.

## To read

- **[The subtle art of not giving a fuck](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck).** This is a rather rude but still pretty straightforward and honest writing on a very interesting subject of rules of paying attention and chosing and object for it, written by Mark Manson who, as we can see, has more subscribers than the population of my whole hometown (2 millions).

- **[How to self-promote your opensource project](https://opensource.com/business/13/2/self-promoting-open-source-projects).** An accidental piece of somebody's thoughts on subject which I came to surfing the web in search for ways to make Oxypogon have at least 10 stars on github (you definitely can help by [starring it](https://github.com/oleggromov/oxypogon)!). Author tells us about promotion, networking and sharing experiences in social networks and other well-known truths of modern world that I too seldom think about.

- **[How do you know you're not living in a computer simulation](https://techxplore.com/news/2016-07-youre-simulation.html).** A small discourse about the close-mindness and limits of human beings' cosciousness to the physical feelings that, obviously, can be falsified with ease and cause the mind to be fooled with just an arbitrary idea of reality. Not very deep one, but interesting for Descartes's famous _“cogito ergo sum”_ (I think therefore I am) citation.

- **[About conditional relationships](https://markmanson.net/what-love-is).** Another one Mark Manson's article. Frighteningly and suddenly made me thinking about different relationships in my life (and I'm neither 15 nor even 20!). If you have ever had a relationship that hadn't met your expectations by some reason, this article has a relatively big chance to give you something to think about.

- **[In defense of being average](https://markmanson.net/being-average).** Mark is my hero for the last week! This topic, maybe, makes the most important one of my deliberate fears for many-many years: almost animal fear of being average or even _looking_ average. If you have anything similar to this mental-social disease (and I think, chances are you have) then read it rapidly, then read it thoughtfully, then tell your friends, argue for it, hate it and repeat the whole thing twice. Being an average seems to be a good result, claims Mark, and in his article he describes why.


## To watch

I often used to say “I don't like movies because they're just loss of time“, but there're so many ways to lose time and much less ways to feel thoughtful (like with the first one) or playful (like with the second one).

- **[Pi, by Darren Aronofsky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/).** Director who's name I even cannot write correctly in English started his career with a movie about paranoid matematician searching for a system in the outside world that can predict the future. It looks very interesting to me, especially after the mainstream bullshit like “Dead Pool” or “Batman vs Superman” (sorry Darren for this awful comparison).

- **[Café Society, by Woody Allen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513674/).** The more movies by W. Allen I watch, the more I like them (and him personally). Glorious characters, perfect dialogs, great music and picture combined with rather simple story make the perfect watch. It's such a pity his movies have end! However, if there would be no end, eventually anyone would be found himself in a Woody Allen's similation of life.

P.S. Unfortunately I cannot understand spoken Enlglish well enough yet to see feature movies without constantly looking into subtitles and then finding unfamiliar words and phrases in dictionary. My writing skills are also lame in both legs therefore I hope those bookmarks will not only help you to find something worthy but also serve me in practicing writing. See you in a week!
